Making this project to brush up basic html and CSS.

# HTML starter webpage:
I have created a basic blog which is the first version of the HTML webpage to practice basic HTML concepts. It introduces the structure of an HTML document with sections like headings, navigation links, paragraphs, and lists.

Features:

Navigation Bar: 
A simple navbar with links to different sections of the site, such as the Blog page.

Content Structure: 
The webpage introduces HTML basics such as paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, and images.
This file contains the main structure of the webpage with the header, article content, and footer.
The article section talks about the basics of HTML and includes a link to an external webpage.
There is an image to make the content visually appealing.

File: 
index.html
blog.html

#CSS Practice:
I practiced integrating CSS to enhance the design and layout of the same webpage above.

Features:

Styling with CSS: 
The webpage uses a dedicated style.css file to style various elements, such as text, images, and the navbar.

Improved Layout: 
The layout is more polished with centered text, justified paragraphs, and an elegant navigation bar.The navigation bar has a background color, and the text is now styled with custom font sizes, colors, and spacing.
The page now looks more visually appealing, with enhanced readability due to proper text alignment.

This project has been a great way to sharpen my skills in HTML and CSS. By creating a simple, yet styled webpage, I have learned how to:
Structure an HTML document with elements like headers, paragraphs, and links.
Style elements using CSS, including text alignment, colors, and layouts.
Implement basic interactivity with anchor tags and links between pages.
Enhance the appearance of a webpage using borders, padding, and margins.
